# Reading-Notes
Here is a repository to record my ideas about the interesting problems I once encountered.

I have found lots of interesting problems and always try to figure out the right ways to solve them. Maybe some of them are not that efficient and sometimes naive, but it records the development of my thinking pattern. So this would be some kind of memory of the past days as a stupid learner.
