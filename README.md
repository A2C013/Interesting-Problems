# Reading-Notes
Here is a repository to record my ideas about the interesting problems I once encountered.

I have found lots of interesting problems and always try to figure out the right ways to solve them. Maybe some of them are not that efficient and sometimes looks foolish, but it records my thinking pattern and developing skills. So this would be a kind of memory of my past days as a stupid learner.

**Then come the problems......**
